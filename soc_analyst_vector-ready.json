  "text": "SOC Analysts are responsible for real-time monitoring of security alerts, identifying potential threats, and escalating incidents to response teams. Their goals include fast detection and containment of attacks, reducing false positives, and improving visibility across systems. They commonly use tools like Splunk, Sentinel, and QRadar to triage alerts and investigate anomalies. They collaborate with IR, threat intelligence, and endpoint teams. Their communication style is brief and actionable, and they value high-confidence alerts over noise. They prefer dashboards, alert summaries, and IOC lists.",
