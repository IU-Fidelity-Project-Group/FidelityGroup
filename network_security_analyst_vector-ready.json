  "text": "Network Security Analysts design and implement defenses to protect on-prem and cloud networks. They configure firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, VPN access, and enforce segmentation policies. They collaborate with IT infrastructure, cloud, and SOC teams to identify vulnerabilities and respond to threats. Their tone is tactical and technical, and they prefer visual aids such as network maps, packet captures, and threat flow diagrams.",
