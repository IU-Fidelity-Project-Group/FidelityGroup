  "text": "Malware Analysts reverse engineer malware samples to understand their behavior, functionality, and origin. Their goals include providing IOCs for detection teams, tracking malware variants targeting the organization, and developing custom detection rules. They use tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, Wireshark, and Cuckoo Sandbox. They collaborate with SOC, threat intelligence, and incident response teams. Their communication style is detailed and technical, favoring in-depth tear-downs, IOCs, and signature logic.",
